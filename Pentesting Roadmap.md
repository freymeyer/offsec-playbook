## ⚠️ Platform Notes & Strategy

**OverTheWire:** Connect via SSH — no browser needed, no account required. Start with Bandit (Linux fundamentals), then Natas (web), Leviathan (UNIX), Krypton (crypto). Each game is self-contained and builds real skills, not just knowledge.

**Root-Me:** Free account gives access to 400+ challenges across web, network, crypto, forensics, and system exploitation. Far more diverse than any single platform. Community solutions teach _why_ things work.

**picoCTF:** Built by Carnegie Mellon security researchers. Permanent archive of all past competitions — hundreds of challenges at no cost. Hints are built in, making it excellent for solo learners.

**HTB Academy Free Strategy:** Register at academy.hackthebox.com. Start with 30 cubes. Every Tier 0 module costs 10 cubes and refunds 10 on completion — chain them indefinitely for free. For Tier 1/2 access, Student plan (~$8/month with academic email) or Silver (~$14/month).

**TCM Security Free Tier:** Register at academy.tcm-sec.com — no credit card required. Includes Linux 100, Programming 100, Practical Help Desk, and Soft Skills for free. Heath Adams' YouTube channel (TheCyberMentor) also has hours of free pentesting content including full Active Directory courses.

**TryHackMe Warning:** Many rooms have moved behind a paywall since 2023. This roadmap uses THM only where rooms are verified free as of early 2026. Always check before starting. If a room has moved to premium, use the listed alternative.

## ⚠️ Anti-Paralysis System

> _Reference whenever you feel stuck, overwhelmed, or don't know what to do._

**Default Action (When You Don't Know What To Study)**

1. Open this roadmap → find today's week → do that day's task
2. If your lab is broken → do an OTW Bandit level or a picoCTF challenge instead
3. If mentally drained → passive: watch IppSec YouTube, read HackTricks, or do a Root-Me "easy" challenge
4. **Minimum viable session:** Open Obsidian, write 3 bullet points about what you learned yesterday

**Stuck on a Machine (Time Rules)**

- 0–15 min: Try everything you know. Document what you've tried.
- 15–30 min: Google the exact service version + "exploit" or "CVE"
- 30 min exactly: Check HackTricks for that specific service
- 45 min: Look at the machine's forum thread or a partial hint
- 60 min: Read a full writeup — but write your own notes afterward
- **Rule:** Never spend >90 min blocked. Learning _why_ something works matters more than solving it alone.

**When Overwhelmed**

- Pick **one task** from the current week only
- Ignore everything else that day
- Completion > perfection

- Write and polish your most professional machine writeup — your best work
- This becomes your "showcase" writeup for job interviews

**Day 3: GitHub Portfolio Final Polish**

- Finalize GitHub portfolio:
    - Pin your best 6 repos
    - Each has a clear README explaining what it demonstrates
    - Contribution graph should show consistent activity across 12 months

**Day 4: Blog Post (Highly Recommended)**

- Write a personal security blog post explaining one technique you mastered this year
- Publish free: GitHub Pages (free), dev.to (free), Medium (free basic tier)
- This signals genuine interest to employers more than any cert
- **Output:** Published blog post with link

**Day 5: Bug Bounty Introduction**

- Study bug bounty programs as parallel income/practice:
    - Platforms: HackerOne (free to join), Bugcrowd (free), Intigriti (free)
    - Starting point: private programs, small scopes, what you've already learned
- 🌿 **Root-Me:** Use your Root-Me profile score and completed challenges as a portfolio piece — it's quantified proof of skill

---

### Week 4 — Launch

**Day 1: Remediation Verification**

- Complete final internal engagement — remediation verification:
    - Have previously reported findings been fixed?
    - Document retest procedures and results
- **Output:** `Internal/Remediation-Verification-Report.md`

**Day 2: Certification Prep Decision**

- Prepare for OSCP or PNPT (choose based on budget):
    - **PNPT** (~$399, TCM Security): Very practical, well-respected, covers AD thoroughly, better value for money
    - **OSCP** (~$1,499, OffSec): Gold standard, highest name recognition, requires 90-day lab access
    - Review syllabi against your 12 months — you're approximately 80% ready for either
- **Output:** `Cert Prep Plan` note

**Day 3: 12-Month Self-Assessment**

- Final `12-Month Self-Assessment`:
    - List every technique you can demonstrate

## 📌 Internal Company Testing — Complete Safety Protocol

### Phase Timeline

|Month|Internal Activity|Risk Level|
|---|---|---|
|2|Passive recon (WHOIS, Shodan, DNS)|None|
|2 W3|Network host discovery (ping sweep)|Very Low|
|3 W3|Service enumeration (specific ports, polite speed)|Low|
|4 W3|Default credential check (management interfaces)|Low|
|5 W3|Web interface passive review|Very Low|
|6 W3|PrivEsc enumeration on test systems|Low|
|8 W3|Cloud surface identification (passive)|None|
|10|Controlled exploitation of non-critical systems|Medium|
|10 W3|Full internal report|—|
|12 W4|Remediation verification|Low|

### What NEVER to Test

- Production display outputs (customer-visible content)
- Video distribution servers during business hours
- Any system labeled as customer-facing
- Authentication systems during peak usage
- Network backbone/switching infrastructure

### Safety Rules

1. Always test at 2–4 AM (lowest traffic)
2. Never use `-T5` scan speed on internal network
3. Always have a rollback plan before touching anything
4. Log every command with timestamp using your `pentest-log.sh` script
5. Stop immediately if any service shows degraded performance
6. Have the company president's phone number ready before starting any test

## 🗺️ Platform Sequencing Guide — When to Use What

This is a rough guide to help you layer platforms intelligently rather than bouncing randomly between them.

**Months 1–2 (Foundation):** OTW Bandit is your primary Linux teacher. picoCTF builds your puzzle-solving instincts. HTB Academy provides structure when you need a "classroom" feel.

**Months 3–4 (Enumeration + Exploitation):** Root-Me becomes a daily habit — solve 3 challenges per week minimum. VulnHub provides full machines to practice end-to-end. HTB Starting Point adds guided machine practice.

**Month 5 (Web):** PortSwigger Academy is non-negotiable — work through it systematically. OWASP Juice Shop is your local web lab. Root-Me Web challenges test your skills against harder targets. OTW Natas teaches web exploitation through pure problem-solving.

**Months 6–8 (PrivEsc + AD):** VulnHub and TCM YouTube carry this phase. Root-Me System and Privilege Escalation challenges provide variety. IppSec walkthroughs teach methodology as much as technique.

**Months 9–12 (Advanced + Launch):** Root-Me as a daily scorecard. picoCTF for competition prep. CTFtime to find live competitions. VulnHub for portfolio machines.
