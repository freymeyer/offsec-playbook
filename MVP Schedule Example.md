## **MINIMUM VIABLE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM - CONCRETE EXAMPLES**

### **2:00pm - Activation Protocol (15 min)**

**What this actually looks like:**

- Alarm goes off. You get up immediately (no snooze, no scroll)
- Walk to kitchen, drink 500ml water in one go
- Do 5 minutes of basic movement:
    - 20 arm circles
    - 10 bodyweight squats
    - 30-second dead hang if you have a bar, or 10 push-ups
    - 5 deep breaths, hands overhead stretch
- Splash cold water on your face at the sink
- Make your coffee while asking yourself: **"What's my ONE hard thing today?"**
    - Example answers: "Finish the OWASP Top 10 SQLi challenge", "Study how JWT tokens work", "Complete 3 TryHackMe rooms on network scanning"

**Why this matters:** You're building a **state change** - going from sleepy to activated. This prevents the "zombie scroll" where you wake up and immediately drift to YouTube.

### **2:15pm - Deep Work Block (90 min)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**Option A - TryHackMe Challenge Day:**

- Open TryHackMe, pick ONE room you've been avoiding (e.g., a hard web exploitation challenge)
- Phone goes in another room or in a drawer, face down
- Block YouTube on your browser (use LeechBlock or Cold Turkey)
- Work on the challenge:
    - Read the room instructions carefully
    - Try to solve it yourself first - when you get stuck, sit with the frustration for 10 minutes
    - Google specific error messages or concepts, but NO ChatGPT to "explain it for you"
    - Take handwritten notes or type them yourself: "What is this teaching me? What did I not understand?"
- When you want to quit (around minute 40), push for 10 more minutes
- At 90 minutes, stop. Note where you are, what you learned, what's still confusing

**Option B - Structured Study Day:**

- Pick ONE cybersecurity topic (e.g., "How do reverse shells actually work?")
- Resources: TryHackMe room, HackTheBox Academy module, or a specific YouTube tutorial series
- Watch/read for 30 minutes, then PRACTICE for 60 minutes:
    - Spin up a VM, try to replicate what you learned
    - Break something intentionally, fix it
    - Type out notes explaining the concept in your own words (no copy-paste from AI)

**Option C - Certification Prep Day:**

- If you're studying for a cert (Security+, CEH, eJPT, etc.):
    - Review 1 domain/chapter
    - Do practice questions for 30 minutes
    - For every wrong answer, write out WHY you got it wrong and the correct concept

**The Rule:** 90 minutes. One topic. No AI shortcuts. Phone away. This is where you build **real competence** so impostor syndrome dies.

### **4:00pm - Movement (30-45 min)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**Mon/Wed/Fri - Jogging Day:**

- Put on running shoes at 3:55pm (prep before the resistance hits)
- 5-minute walk to warm up
- Jog for 25-30 minutes at a conversational pace (you could talk if needed)
- 5-minute walk to cool down
- Total: 35-40 minutes outside
- Optional: listen to a cybersecurity podcast (Darknet Diaries, Risky Business) while jogging

**Tue/Thu/Sat - Active Recovery:**

- 30-minute walk around your area
- OR: bodyweight circuit at home:
    - 3 rounds of: 10 push-ups, 15 squats, 20-second plank, 10 lunges each leg
    - Rest 90 seconds between rounds
- OR: Follow a 20-minute YouTube bodyweight workout (search "beginner bodyweight circuit")

**Sunday - Rest or Light Stretch:**

- 15 minutes of stretching/yoga
- OR complete rest day if your body needs it

**The Rule:** Something moves every day at 4pm. Feeling groggy is not a reason to skip, it's the reason you must go. You're training consistency, not performance.

### **5:00pm - Fuel & Prep (1 hour)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**5:00-5:30pm - Eat Your Meal:**

- Whatever you normally eat at "2pm" (rice, protein, veggies - night shift meals are flexible)
- Eat sitting down, not at your computer
- Hydrate with water, not just coffee

**5:30-5:45pm - Review Deep Work:**

- Open your notes from the 2:15pm session
- Answer in writing:
    - "What did I actually learn today?"
    - "What's still confusing that I need to revisit tomorrow?"
    - "Did I avoid anything difficult? Why?"

**5:45-6:00pm - Prep for Work:**

- Mental transition: review your work tasks for tonight
- Pack food/water for your shift
- Set up anything you need (uniform, ID, etc.)

---

### **6:00pm - Buffer Time (2 hours)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**6:00-8:00pm - Gaming (Time-Boxed):**

- Set a **loud alarm for 7:50pm** before you start
- Play your game (Valorant, Dota, whatever you're into)
- At 7:50pm alarm: finish the current match/round, then STOP
- No "one more game" - this is where discipline is built

**OR Alternative Activities:**

- Watch YouTube (set the same timer)
- Read articles/blogs about cybersecurity news
- Work on a personal project (build a home lab, script something)
- Socialize with friends online

**The Rule:** This is your reward time, but it has boundaries. The alarm is non-negotiable. You're proving to yourself you can control dopamine activities.

---

### **8:00pm - Pre-Work Meal**

- Eat your dinner
- Transition mentally to work mode
- Head to work or log in

---

### **10:00pm-6:00am - Work Shift**

- You're already doing this
- Stay hydrated (bring a water bottle)
- If you have downtime, resist the urge to mindlessly scroll - use it to review today's learning or plan tomorrow's deep work topic

---

### **6:00am - Decompression (30 min)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**6:00-6:20am - Post-Work Meal:**

- Eat your final meal of the day
- Light food is better (you don't want to sleep on a full stomach)

**6:20-6:30am - Wind Down (NO SCREENS):**

- This is the hardest one for most people
- Options:
    - Read a physical book (fiction, manga, anything non-stimulating)
    - Journal: "What went well today? What didn't? What's tomorrow's ONE hard thing?"
    - Sit quietly and breathe
    - Talk to family if they're awake
- Lights should be dim
- Phone is charging across the room

**The Rule:** Your brain needs to know "the day is ending" even though it's morning. Blue light at 6:30am destroys your sleep. This is non-negotiable.

---

### **6:30am - Sleep Prep (30 min)**

**What this actually looks like:**

**6:30-6:45am - Hygiene:**

- Brush teeth
- Shower if it helps you sleep (some people prefer it)
- Change into comfortable sleep clothes

**6:45-7:00am - Room Prep:**

- Blackout curtains closed (critical for day sleep)
- Fan or white noise on
- Phone on silent, across the room (NOT on your nightstand)
- Room temp cool (around 18-20°C if possible)

**7:00am - In Bed:**

- 5 minutes of box breathing: 4 seconds in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold
- OR progressive muscle relaxation
- Lights out, eyes closed

**Goal: Asleep by 7:30am**

---

## **EXAMPLE FULL DAY**

**Tuesday:**

- 2:00pm: Wake up, water, 5-min movement, coffee, decide today's focus is "SQL injection basics"
- 2:15pm: TryHackMe SQL injection room, struggle through challenges, take handwritten notes
- 3:45pm: Stop deep work, brain is tired but satisfied
- 4:00pm: Active recovery - 30-min bodyweight circuit at home
- 4:35pm: Shower, feel energized
- 5:00pm: Eat meal, review what I learned about SQL injection
- 6:00pm: Play Valorant with timer set for 7:50pm
- 7:50pm: Alarm goes off mid-game, finish round, log off
- 8:00pm: Eat dinner, prep for work
- 10:00pm-6:00am: Work shift at OJT
- 6:00am: Get home, eat light snack
- 6:20am: Read manga for 10 minutes (lights dim, no phone)
- 6:30am: Brush teeth, blackout curtains, white noise on
- 7:00am: In bed, breathing exercises
- 7:20am: Asleep

**Scorecard:**

- ✅ Deep Work (90 min on SQL injection)
- ✅ Movement (bodyweight circuit)
- ✅ Screens off by 6:30am (read manga instead)
- ✅ No AI crutches (handwritten notes, struggled through myself)
- ✅ In bed by 7:00am

**Score: 5/5**

**One thing I learned:** SQL injection works by breaking out of SQL query syntax with special characters

**One thing I avoided:** Wanted to use ChatGPT to explain a concept but pushed through on my own
